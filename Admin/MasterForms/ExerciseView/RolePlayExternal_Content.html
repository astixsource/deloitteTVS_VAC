                    <p><strong>The Context</strong></p>
                    <p>Delish Deliveries, a rapidly expanding food delivery platform, and NextGen Motors have entered an exclusive five-year contract for the design, production, delivery, and maintenance/diagnostic services of 50,000 electric scooters in select cities across the region. This collaboration has resulted in a unique model of electric two-wheeler specifically tailored to meet the needs of Delish&rsquo;s delivery executives.</p>
                    <p>Key features of this model named eZypp include superior handling to navigate on Indian roads, a specialized compartment to store food packages, and easily replaceable battery packs.</p>
                    <p>It is expected that these special design elements will increase the efficiency of Delish&rsquo;s delivery executives, thus increasing their productivity by around 7-10%. If this became true, then Delish would have a competitive edge over its competitors when it came to average delivery time of delivery executives.</p>
                    <p>In addition, NextGen will have a dedicated team of experts for the maintenance of these vehicles and will provide quick services to these executives. All faulty parts/components detected will be replaced free of cost over the next five years, as per the terms of the contract.</p>
                    <p><strong>Delivery and Revenue Projections</strong></p>
                    <p>The scooters will be delivered in batches every six months, with the overall revenue projected from this partnership amounting to approximately Rs 625 crores over five years. The first batch of 5,000 scooters was completed and delivered six months ago, garnering extensive press coverage. This coverage significantly boosted NextGen&rsquo;s strategy to associate its brand with sustainability.</p>
                    <p><strong>The Situation</strong></p>
                    <p>In recent months, there has been a noticeable increase in reports of vehicular breakdowns experienced by Delish&rsquo;s delivery partners. Internal investigations suggest a potential issue with battery pack overheating, which is suspected to be the primary cause of these breakdowns. Once identified, the design issues with the battery packs were quickly rectified. It has been 2-3 weeks since these design issues were rectified and now the second batch of 5,000 units (with the new battery packs) is ready for dispatch.</p>
                    <p>You have received an email from Bhavya Ranjan, the Operations Head of Delish Deliveries, addressing these concerns and seeking a resolution.</p>
                    <p>___________________________________________________________________</p>
                    <p><em>To,</em></p>
                    <p><em>Mr Sashi Grewal</em></p>
                    <p><em>Regional Manager, After Sales</em></p>
                    <p><em>NextGen</em></p>
                    <p><em>Subject: Replacement of eZypp electric scooter across the region</em></p>
                    <p><em>Dear Shashi,</em></p>
                    <p><em>We had entered this partnership 2 years ago with a vision to provide sustainable mobility to all our delivery executives across the region. As you know, the eZypp model was designed keeping the unique requirements of our executives and the conditions they operate in. We began well, and our operators found ease in commuting and delivering with these vehicles. However, in the last couple of months, we have found out that the average time for delivery has actually increased across the region</em><em>. This is mainly because of the increase in the number of incidents of breakdown of these scooters.</em></p>
                    <p><em>I understand that the NextGen team has identified and rectified these issues in the design and the next batch of 5000 units will not face such overheating issues. However, we at Delish firmly believe that the 5000 scooters that are still on the roads are a major cause of concern, both from a business perspective as well as from the perspective of well-being of our executives.</em></p>
                    <p><em>I request you to take swift action and get these 5000 units replaced with the new units and deliver another 5000 units within the next 2 months.</em></p>
                    <p><em>Regards,</em></p>
                    <p><em>Bhavya Ranjan </em></p>
                    <p>________________________________________________________________________</p>

                    <p><strong>Your Role</strong></p>
                    <p>You are Shashi Grewal, a Regional after-sales service manager at NextGen Motors and you oversee the service operations of multiple automobile service centres within your region.</p>
                   <p><strong>Your Role</strong></p>
            <p>You are Shashi Grewal, a Regional after-sales service manager at NextGen Motors and you oversee the service operations of multiple automobile service centres within your region.</p>
            <p>This email is quite shocking to you as the replacement of all 5000 units with new ones upon detection of design flaws is not a part of the contract. The contract clearly mentions about the replacement of the flawed components, which in this case would be the replacement of the 5000 battery packs, which will take at least 10 weeks.</p>
            <p>Upon investigation, you have found out the following:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Over the past 6 months, there have been cases of 500 scooters which were brought to different service centres across the region with issues of battery over-heating and the battery packs were replaced.</li>
                <li>Out of the 500, only 150 scooters got the replacement done with the newly designed battery packs. This was because they were brought to the service centre after the design flaws were rectified.</li>
                <li>For the other 350, the replacements were done with the previous design, which still had the design flaws.</li>
                <li>Thus, out of the 5000 units&rsquo; battery packs, replacement has been completed for 150 till now.</li>
                <li>The process for the replacement of other 4850 battery packs has not been initiated yet.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>This matter was escalated to your leadership, and they want quick solution to the situation at hand. NextGen cannot afford to receive any negative media coverage as it will be disastrous to the business.</p>
            <p>Adding to this, NextGen has to deliver the next batch as per the contract. Dibakar Banerjee, the head of production department at Nextgen has expressed his concerns regarding issues related to quality if the department is pushed to manufacture 5000 new units in such crunched timelines.</p>
            <p>You have asked for a 15 minute meeting with Bhavya. In these 15 minutes you have to come to a mutually agreeable solution, one that is realistic and takes care of the interests of both the parties.&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Your Task</strong></p>
            <p>Over the next 15 minutes, you should be able to: -</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Identify priorities of the stakeholder.</li>
                <li>Explore various alternatives to arrive at a solution.</li>
                <li>Review the impact of the decision taken across the short and long term of the relationship.</li>
                <li>Conclude on a solution that is agreeable to both parties.</li>
            </ul>

                <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane fade" id="CSTab-3">
                    <p>Your  organisation uses a network of franchised dealers across regions to perform the  initial sales process as well as delivery of after-sales service. You believe that dealer services are a commodity and  that their quality affects sales. Any reduction in sales at the dealer&rsquo;s end  will be detrimental to your company&rsquo;s sales. You have therefore taken the signs  of weakening of sales in one particular dealer&rsquo;s region seriously enough to  stem the tide.</p>
                    <p>You are aware that different factors impact sales at the dealer level.  Whatever be the advertisement and promotions done by the manufacturers at the  corporate level, customer service at the dealer&rsquo;s end plays an important part.  It is at the dealer&rsquo;s showroom that customers experience their moments of truth.  Unfortunately, negative experiences are shared faster and more in comparison to  positive ones.</p>
                    <p>Venus Motors has been one of your star dealers and had contributed to over  12% of sales in the region in the last 4 years consistently. You have won  accolades from your company due to the contributions from Venus in the past.  However, there has been a sudden decline of sales in the last 6 months, and you  are surprised with the development. If you allow the decline to continue further, it will negatively  impact the sales of your organization.</p>
                    <p>You have been monitoring the monthly sales data and have sought information from the dealer, but the explanations sounded hollow in your opinion. Your suggestions on how to improve sales have fallen on deaf ears, is what you think. There are regular customer satisfaction surveys conducted at each of the dealerships and it would be useful to understand the results of these surveys conducted in the last 6 months from Shivraj. You also have some inside information from the market that that dealer has started another dealership in the name of his relative for selling the vehicles of your competitor. You suspect that some of the enquiries are being directed to the new venture, selling the competitor&rsquo;s vehicles. But you will not be in a position to challenge that legitimate business activity, though it is undermining the sales of your company vehicles.</p>
                    <p>On the last count, overall sales of MotorTek&rsquo;s vehicles in your region have been stable in most dealerships, and shown a steady increase in some, with the exception of Venus Motors. With the automobile space becoming more competitive with players catering to meet all kinds of needs of customers, the competition is stiff and consumer preferences are changing rapidly. There is a need to quickly understand and pre-empt customer preferences to be able to deliver on their needs.</p>
                    <p>As you tick all the boxes of customer service parameters, you wonder why  the sales with this dealer have declined and you are determined to find out.</p>
                    <p>You are  meeting with the dealer, Shivraj Dubey, sole owner of Venus Motors, in a few  minutes from now.</p>
                    <p>Expected outcomes from this meeting are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>To elicit ways to improve sales </li>
                        <li>To seek evidence of the dealer&rsquo;s commitment to the  brand</li>
                        <li>To discuss consequences of continued decline in sales</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 class="small-heading">Venus  Motors</h4>
                    <p>Venus Motors is solely owned by Shivraj Dubey. The dealership has excellent facilities like a vast warehouse to keep the new vehicles and also to carry out servicing of vehicles of your company. In addition, the front facing staff dealing with customer service, technical staff and billing counters are well trained and motivated. They are experienced staff and attrition at Venus has been less than the industry average due to superior salary and terms of service. While this has been the case for the last few years, Shivraj has recently lost some of his key performers in customer service to competitors.</p>
