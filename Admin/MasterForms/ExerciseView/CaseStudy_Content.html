                        <li>Capabilities that are developed over a longer period, even though associated with lower returns, are more likely to be effective when they are brought to the market. However, by that time, chances are that competition has caught up.</li>
                        <li>There are some capabilities that an organization must develop to stay relevant in the market. These can bring lower returns but are critical for the organization to survive.</li>
                        <li>Some capabilities and initiatives have hidden value. That is, on paper they might not be as lucrative, but they can influence public perception which can lead to long term sustainability.</li>
