                    <p>Over the last few years, NextGen Motors has invested in new areas for rapid growth in various markets. Here are few noteworthy initiatives.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Expansion in South-East Asia Market: </strong>NextGen Motors penetrated the southeast Asian market 2 years ago, and currently has a market share of 6.5% in the region. Over the last few months, the leadership has decided to focus on increasing sales, focusing on the rural market. The organization is also looking for opportunities to expand the after sales network within these countries.</li>
                        <li><strong>Strategic Partnership with Delish: </strong>NextGen Motors and Delish Deliveries (a growing food ordering and delivery service) have entered an exclusive five-year contract where all Delish delivery partners will be provided customized NextGen Motors&rsquo;s electric scooters and after sales maintenance. This contract is exclusive to your region within the country.</li>
                        <li><strong>Smartphone Application:</strong> The NextGen Motors smartphone application is exclusive for all NextGen Motors customers, through which they get access to the various products, accessories, and services of NextGen Motors. The app can also be used for monitoring vehicle performance, detect vehicle location, and allows the customer to opt for software and firmware updates on the vehicle. This is made possible via the IOT sensors present in various components of all NextGen Motors models, a strategic move made by the organization few years ago.</li>
                        <li><strong>Launch of Neon Electric scooter:</strong> This new model of electric scooters will provide the highest battery efficiency and range. The battery pack in this model has been designed in collaboration with a German two-wheeler manufacturer.</li>
