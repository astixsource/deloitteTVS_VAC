                    <p>You are Shashi, a Regional after-sales service manager at NextGen Motors, a leading company in the two-wheeler electric vehicle industry in India. After-sales service and customer satisfaction have been one of the distinguishing factors of NextGen Motors.</p>
                    <p>In the last few years, the organization has been looking to grow its business beyond its current markets. It expanded to the Southeast Asian market in countries like Philippines, Myanmar, Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia 2 years ago after reviewing the market conditions. Currently NextGen holds 6.5% of the market share in the entire region. Given the competitive landscape of the EV two-wheeler market and the time it takes for a new entrant to establish itself, NextGen has secured a significant market share.</p>
                    <p>In the next 3 years, NextGen&rsquo;s focus is to increase the market presence to 11% in these countries. Since the focus has been mostly to make its presence in the urban areas, it feels that there is scope to explore its potential in the rural areas now. To support this, after-sales strategy also needs to grow alongside sales to cater to the growth.</p>
                    <p>NextGen&rsquo;s commitment to innovation and customer satisfaction has helped build a loyal customer base. Additionally, the company also has a dedicated team based out of India providing specialized services which require expertise in special areas.</p>
                    <p>Now, with its focus on expanding market share, the organization has called in for a strategy meeting.</p>
                    <p><strong>Key Discussion</strong></p>
                    <p>The Regional Heads of NextGen are invited to a strategy meeting discussion.&nbsp; You along with other Regional Heads are expected to plan and strategize on how NextGen can expand its after-sales service network profitably in the Southeast Asian market. The meeting duration is 40 minutes, and you have 30 minutes to prepare for the discussion, with the following agenda:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Formulate an after-sales strategy aligned with the sales strategy to increase the market share from 6.5% to 11%.</li>
                        <li>Establish a set of performance indicators to evaluate the effectiveness of the expansion strategy focusing on customer satisfaction.</li>
                        <li>Create an implementation plan to meet the above objectives across the short and long term.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Points to Consider</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Assess the unique challenges and opportunities present in the Southeast Asian after-sales service sector that NextGen may encounter.</li>
                        <li>Utilize advanced technology to enhance the efficiency of after-sales service operations and ensure a smooth customer experience.</li>
                        <li>Maintain uniformity in service quality across all countries/regions to uphold NextGen's standards.</li>
                    </ul>

                                    <p>VoltWheels and EcoRide Motors dominate the local market, making them preferred employers due to their strong presence and community ties. Currently, NextGen's local Talent Acquisition team is working hard to build robust sales teams. The after-sales service team consists of 1,000 employees in India coordinating with 200 regional employees. However, this model is unsustainable for NextGen's expansion plans. Therefore, an effective talent acquisition strategy is essential for both sales and after-sales teams in the region.</p>
