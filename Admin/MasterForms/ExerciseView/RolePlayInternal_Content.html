                    <p><strong>Situation </strong></p>
                    <p>NextGen Motors is planning to launch a program to provide diagnostic and servicing support through &ldquo;Workshop on Wheels&rdquo;. This is one of the key initiatives taken to increase the customer satisfaction ratings which has always been NextGen&rsquo;s primary value and a differentiator in the market. &nbsp;</p>
                    <p>The program will be launched across all the key cities identified by the organisation in phases across the next three years, the first one being planned in Bangalore. The leadership team believes that the smooth execution of the pilot is critical to understanding how the customers are receiving this service.</p>
                    <p>This pilot is led by Prasanna, a newly promoted service manager. He has been chosen to lead this initiative due to his strong track record in contributing to critical projects as a subject matter expert.</p>
                    <p><strong>About Prasanna</strong></p>
                    <p>Prasanna joined NextGen 6 years ago and quickly rose through the ranks due to his consistent high performance. In addition to his exemplary technical skills, he has proven to have a deep understanding of the business. Recently, he was promoted after Rajat, the previous Service Manager transitioned out of the role. Prasanna is currently responsible for managing a team of 25 Technical staff, 8 Service Advisors and quality control staff, and 3 Customer Service Representatives single-handedly.</p>
                    <p>This is Prasanna&rsquo;s first project as a service manager since his promotion. Given the critical importance of the mobile service centers to the company's operations, coupled with Prasanna's impressive track record of excellence, the expectations from all stakeholders, managers, and regional heads are notably high. Prasanna is expected to collaborate not only with multiple departments&mdash;including the R&amp;D team, marketing team, human resources team, and engineers&mdash;but also with other service stations in Bangalore to ensure the smooth delivery of the project.</p>
                    <p>In his previous role, Prasanna had been part of major projects as a tech expert and was the go-to person for technical issues . Additionally, while he has been working with cross functional teams, in this case, he is leading them along with managing his own team. All this is new to him and is quite overwhelmed.</p>
                    <p>The recent reviews of the project show a considerable delay and has the potential to affect the launch of the program. If this program is not launched on time NextGen will lose out on first mover advantage and will bring down the organisation&rsquo;s credibility in the market.</p>
                    <p>You decide to talk to Prasanna about it. Recently, during one of your informal conversations with your colleagues you also heard rumours about growing unrest in Prasanna&rsquo;s team.</p>

                    <p><strong>Your Role</strong></p>
                    <p>You are Shashi Grewal, a Regional Service Manager at NexGen Motors. You oversee the service operations of multiple automobile service centres within your region. Your primary responsibilities include ensuring high-quality service delivery, innovation, and meeting deadlines for new initiatives.</p>
                    <p><strong>Your Task:</strong></p>
                    <p>You schedule a meeting with Prasanna to understand the challenges faced by him. You also want to discuss potential solutions both for the success of this project and his overall growth in the new role.</p>
                    <p>This exercise allows you 15 minutes to prepare for the meeting with Prasanna (during which time you may make notes if you wish) and 20 minutes for the meeting itself.</p>
                    <p>In the meeting, you should aim to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Understand the root causes of the project delays and arrive at steps to get the project back on track.</li>
                        <li>Identify gaps &amp; offer guidance to Prasanna on improving his leadership style and to rebuild trust with the team.</li>
                        <li>Inspire Prasanna to take the required action.</li>

                    <h4 class="small-heading">Deepak  Dewan</h4>
                    <p>Deepak Dewan has earned a Bachelors in Technology from IIT Madras. He has worked with two other leading automotive organisations before moving to MotorTek. At MotorTek, he has been involved in delivering some key projects and is viewed as someone who can deliver in a difficult situation. He has also been recognised with multiple awards during his career especially for Delivery Efficiency and Innovation. Deepak has been a star performer for most parts of his career. Deepak&rsquo;s approach of getting things done and his skill in managing deadlines has been appreciated over the years, although this may also result in him being perceived as a task master and can come across as slightly demanding of his team members at times.</p>
                </div>
                <!-- Tab panes 4-->
                <div role="tabpanel" class="tab-pane fade" id="CSTab-4">
                    <p>Over the last 6 months, however, his performance seems to have been impacted adversely. He has had to extend deadlines a couple of times, there has been a stakeholder escalation too. Normally, such an escalation would have caught Deepak&rsquo;s attention and he would have tried to find the underlying cause of things and not just set it right, but also set up preventive measures. However lately he appears to be slow on the uptake.</p>
                    <p>Right now, Deepak&rsquo;s behaviour and work standards at best could be considered average.&nbsp;Deepak shows little enthusiasm for the job and appears to lack commitment. This has also affected the performance of fellow team members in the department, who are falling short of meeting timelines finalized with the stakeholders.&nbsp;Productivity levels have dipped slightly, and absenteeism rates have increased. This does not appear to concern Deepak who tends to either avoid contact with fellow team members or be abrupt with them, and on a couple of occasions has even lost his cool with them. You have personally witnessed Deepak losing his temper and responding in a rather curt manner towards someone in the team, during the last fortnight.</p>
                    <p>You have also received information from the system about Deepak not being given a promotion last year while his colleague got one. You understand from past appraisal data that this could have been due to some gaps in the suitability to the new role requirements at that point in time. And to fulfil these, he was recommended some development initiatives by the previous manager. However, as the previous manager had to leave unexpectedly, the development initiatives were not pursued or followed up diligently. This could have been one of the triggers for Deepak&rsquo;s unhappiness in the current role.</p>
                    <p>What worries you the most is that Deepak is now being considered by the management to move up the ladder, basis his past performance records and tenure. You would like Deepak to measure up to the new role that is coming up in Business planning & Strategy.</p>

                    <h4 class="small-heading">Message from the Head of Operations</h4>
                    <p><em>SUBJECT: Delay in delivery of Engines</em></p>
                    <p>Dear Sampath,</p>
                    <p>I am writing to bring to your attention the surprisingly low quality of output I have received from your department lately.</p>
                    <p>I&rsquo;m sure you know that MotorTek is regarded as one of the prime and preferred suppliers of scooters to Africa, Southeast Asia, Indian Sub-Continent and Central and Latin America. We are aiming at one million export mark in 2022. You realise that this underscores our path towards being a global player in personal mobility solutions.</p>
                    <p>As you know, we won the huge order from Chile in March. One of the reasons that we won this bid was because we were able to offer very attractive terms on service delivery and turnaround time which, in turn, depends upon everyone in the production team being able to meet the strenuous specifications.</p>
                    <p>I very much regret that the performance has not been forthcoming.&nbsp;With less than 6 weeks to go, we have only been supplied 60% of the engines required and now there is a strong possibility of not meeting the deadline that was committed to the client in Chile. Failure to deliver to such a prestigious client could ruin our chances of making the one million mark.</p>
                    <p>Last week when I telephoned Deepak, he was non-confirming to say the least and made several excuses in relation to the problem.&nbsp; As of now, I have not received any information on how we plan to deliver on the scheduled date.&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>In view of this obvious lack of concern towards meeting SLA, I must inform you that I will be forced to escalate the matter to the MD if things don&rsquo;t improve over the next few weeks.</p>
                    <p>Regards,</p>
                    <p>Som Chatterjee</p>
