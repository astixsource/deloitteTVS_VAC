                    <p>NextGen has faced a 35% increase in customer complaints over the last six months, causing delays in vehicle servicing. This rise in complaints coincides with the introduction of a new model variant one year ago. An external consultant was hired to investigate and provide recommendations. While some corrective actions have been implemented of the recommendations made, others require careful consideration due to the associated risks. You are responsible for reviewing the consultant's recommendations to decide on the best course of action.</p>

                    <p>The project is related  to Vehicle-to-vehicle communication (V2V). Put simply, this technology will  allow vehicles on the road to communicate with each other wirelessly in case of  an emergency. For this, two-wheelers  will need to be equipped with sensors to measure speed, braking, location, etc.  Vehicle-to-vehicle communication&rsquo;s ability to wirelessly exchange information  about the speed and position of surrounding vehicles will help avoid crashes,  ease traffic congestion, and improve the environment.</p>
