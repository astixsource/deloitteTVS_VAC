                <h4 class="middle-title">Krakozhia – Background and Demographics</h4>
                <p>Krakozhia,  officially the &lsquo;<em>Republic of Krakozhia</em>&rsquo;,  is a country in the South western part of Asia. It is a federal republic governed  under a parliamentary system, consists of 18 states and 5 union territories and  its capital is <em>Krazville</em>. The  population consists of close to 80 percent Muslims. Their native language is  Krakish and the culture is based on their Muslim religion which is observed  strongly across the nation.</p>
                <p>The  country has a vast landmass, including extensive mountainous areas with the  majority of the 22 million population inhabiting the flatter areas. Their  currency is called the Krakozhian Dollars (KD). In 2020, Krakozhia emerged as  one of the world's fastest-growing economies. </p>

                <h4 class="middle-title">Key challenges</h4>
                <p>Despite  having a favorable demographic profile, labor and skill shortage is one of the  key concerns for the Krakozhian industry. A survey administered across leading  EPC (Engineering, Procurement and Construction) companies in the country  indicated that they are unable to find adequate number of skilled workers for  running their operations. Companies have also reported that they are facing the  brunt of this shortage in the form of slippages in meeting confirmed orders.  Also, there is an upward pressure on wages that is now pervasive.</p>
                <!-- insert image 0 here -->
                <img src="../../Images/set-1_cb-img_0.jpg" class="img-thumbnail mb-1 mr-3 pull-left" alt="Image0" style="width: 40%" />
                <p>The  country struggles with a number of significant barriers that continue to hamper  the development of urban infrastructure: Corruption, complex leadership  structures, poor infrastructure, capability gaps (due to illiteracy and  insufficient skills development) and fiscal deficits are a drag on the  development. Krakozhia needs to address the current problems of developing good  infrastructure, solid waste disposal, flood management, storm water, sewage and  drainage system etc. resulting in urban decay, traffic gridlock and thereby a  deteriorating quality of life for many of its citizens.</p>
                <p>The wave  of urbanization that is sweeping across Krakozhia represents one of the greatest  opportunities as well as one of its most serious challenges. The country requires  a highly efficient and sustainable solution for servicing urban areas and can  reap the benefits by using technology from other parts of the world. </p>
                <h4 class="middle-title">Current Political scenario</h4>
                <p>Krakozhia  underwent an election in the year 2016 and the citizens chose the new Government  with the hope of reviving and reinvigorating the country. The elected  Government stood true to their promises and in the last four years, Krakozhia  has taken major strides towards development in a short span of time and hence  got re-elected in 2021.</p>
                <p>A new round  of elections is due in 2026 as the current regime completes its tenure. The  Government has identified building smart cities — world-class, self-sustainable  habitats as a key imperative to win over the confidence of Krakozhians once  again and get re-elected. Hence, the effective execution and timely completion  of the &lsquo;<em>IRIS City&rsquo; </em>Project is a key,  high priority agenda for the political realm. </p>

                <h4 class="middle-title">The Smart City way</h4>
                <p>According to the United Nations, the proportion of urban  population in Krakozhia is expected to increase dramatically to the point that  by 2050, almost 70% of its population will become urban. Left unchanged, rising  populations and the subsequent impact on energy resources is creating an  unsustainable future for the country.</p>
                <p>In  such a context, the <em>Smart City</em> concept has appeared as a new paradigm of intelligent urban development and as  an important factor to shape sustainable socio-economic growth. A Smart City  can be referred to as a planned, coordinated and interconnected digital system  of citizens, transports, communications, services, infrastructure and  utilities.</p>

                    <p>The site for the proposed smart city has a total area of  100 square kilometers. It is planned adjacent to the already developed capital  city of Krazville and hence enjoys the availability of existing and proposed  transportation networks and physical infrastructure. The land for the delineated  site is already acquired and the location of the site along the city of  Krazville is given in Figure 1. </p>
                    <p>The  project aims to attract skilled human resource and generate direct employment  for about 58,000 people.</p>
                    <p>The  master-plan for the city is approved, land has been acquired and partners have  been chosen by the Government of Krakozhia.</p>
